<objective>
Set GitHub repository metadata for discoverability: add 5 topics via gh CLI (automated) and upload a social preview image (manual — no GitHub API exists for this).

Purpose: Topics make the repo discoverable in GitHub search. The social preview image provides a professional first impression when the URL is shared on social media or in Slack.
Output: Repository has 5 topics set; user has uploaded (or consciously deferred) the social preview image.

  <name>Task 1: Add 5 repository topics via gh CLI</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run the following command to add 5 topics to the GitHub repository. The current topics list is empty (confirmed by research).

    ```bash
    gh repo edit d44b/pulltrace \
      --add-topic kubernetes \
      --add-topic monitoring \
      --add-topic containers \
      --add-topic helm \
      --add-topic containerd
    ```

    Then verify the topics were applied:
    ```bash
    gh api repos/d44b/pulltrace --jq '.topics'
    ```

    Expected output: `["containers","containerd","helm","kubernetes","monitoring"]` (order may vary).

    If the gh CLI returns an auth error, surface it as a blocked state and do not continue. Do not attempt to use the GitHub web UI as a substitute — this is a scriptable operation.

    <manual>
      **Step 1 — Verify topics are visible on GitHub:**
      Browse to https://github.com/d44b/pulltrace — confirm you see the 5 topic tags below the repository description.

      **Step 2 — Upload social preview image (manual — no API exists):**
      1. Go to https://github.com/d44b/pulltrace/settings (Repository Settings)
      2. Scroll to "Social preview" section
      3. Click "Edit" and upload a 1280x640px PNG or JPG
      4. Recommended: Use a screenshot of the Pulltrace UI or a simple branded image with the project name
      5. Click "Save changes"

      If you want to defer the social preview, that is acceptable — type "approved, skipped social preview" and it will be noted.

      **Step 3 — Verify social preview (optional):**
      After uploading: share https://github.com/d44b/pulltrace in a Slack message or use a link preview checker to confirm the OG image appears.
