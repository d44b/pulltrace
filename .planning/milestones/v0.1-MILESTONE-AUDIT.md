# Milestone Audit: Pulltrace v0.1

**Milestone:** v0.1.0 Open Source Release
**Audited:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** ⚠ gaps_found
**Phases:** 4/4 completed

---

## Executive Summary

All 18 v1 requirements are covered. Cross-phase integration is largely correct. One integration gap was found: the README.md Quick Start `helm repo add` command uses the wrong URL (missing `/charts` suffix), meaning users who land on the GitHub repo page and follow the README will fail to add the Helm repo. The actual Helm infrastructure (index.yaml, chart .tgz, CI pipeline) is working correctly — the gap is purely in the README documentation.

Accumulated tech debt spans documentation staleness (stale checkboxes, missing SUMMARY fields, stale ROADMAP phase status) and one incomplete manual step (social preview image). No runtime blockers.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

| Requirement | Phase | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|-------------|-------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| COMM-01 | Phase 1 | SATISFIED | listed (01-01) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| COMM-02 | Phase 1 | SATISFIED | listed (01-01) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| FIX-01 | Phase 1 | SATISFIED | missing (01-02: `[]`) | `[x]` | **partial** (SUMMARY gap — code verified) |
| FIX-02 | Phase 1 | SATISFIED | missing (01-02: `[]`) | `[x]` | **partial** (SUMMARY gap — code verified) |
| META-01 | Phase 1 | PARTIALLY SATISFIED | listed (01-03) | `[x]` | **partial** (social preview human step pending) |

| DOCS-05 | Phase 2 | PASS + live confirmed by Phase 3 | listed (02-01) | `[ ]` | **satisfied** (update checkbox) |
| HELM-01 | Phase 3 | SATISFIED | missing (no field) | `[x]` | **partial** (SUMMARY field absent) |

| REL-02 | Phase 3 | SATISFIED | missing (no field) | `[x]` | **partial** (SUMMARY field absent) |
| REL-03 | Phase 4 | SATISFIED | listed (04-01) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| REL-04 | Phase 4 | SATISFIED | listed (04-02) | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

**COMM-03** — removed from scope (intentionally omitted, not a requirement).

**Score: 18/18 requirements covered. 9 fully satisfied, 0 unsatisfied, 9 partial (documentation tracking gaps only).**

### Orphan Detection

No orphaned requirements. All 18 traceability table entries map to a phase with a VERIFICATION.md that covers the requirement. All requirements appear in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md.

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Status | Score | Critical Gaps | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| 01-foundation-files | human_needed | 5/5 | None | Social preview upload is only human-required item (no API) |
| 02-documentation-site | human_needed | 5/5 automated | None | Live site confirmed HTTP 200 by Phase 3 re-verification |
| 03-release-automation | **passed** | 5/5 (re-verified live) | None | All live checks passed 2026-02-23 |
| 04-launch | human_needed | 8/9 effectively | None | Docker/Helm pull confirmation needed (tooling not local); all API evidence confirms public + tagged |

No phases have missing VERIFICATION.md. No phases have critical gaps.

## Integration Check

### Wiring Summary

| Cross-Phase Link | Status | Evidence |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1 CHANGELOG.md → Phase 3 github-release body | WIRED | ci.yml:245 links to CHANGELOG.md |
| Phase 2 docs.yml deploy-gh-pages concurrency → Phase 3 ci.yml concurrency | WIRED | Both share `group: deploy-gh-pages, cancel-in-progress: false` |
| Phase 2 docs/installation.md helm URL → Phase 3 deployed index.yaml | WIRED | docs/installation.md uses correct `/charts` URL |
| Phase 3 ci.yml helm-release → Phase 4 tag push CI run | WIRED | CI run #22316078048 all 7 jobs green |
| Phase 3 GHCR push → Phase 4 public package visibility | WIRED | gh api confirms all 3 packages public |
| Phase 1 server.go fixes → FIX-01/FIX-02 runtime behavior | WIRED | PullErrors.Inc(), BytesPerSec, MediaType all present in server.go |

### Integration Gap

**MISS-01: README.md Quick Start — wrong `helm repo add` URL**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Location | `README.md:50` |
| Current | `helm repo add pulltrace https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace` |
| Correct | `helm repo add pulltrace https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace/charts` |
| Impact | User silently fails — helm appends `/index.yaml` to the given URL, fetching the MkDocs HTML home page, which fails YAML parsing with no useful error message |
| Affected Requirements | HELM-01, HELM-02, REL-04 |
| Scope note | All other locations (docs/installation.md, docs/index.md, ci.yml release body) use the correct URL. README was not in any phase's scope. |

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Breaks At |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Semver tag → full CI pipeline → GitHub Release | COMPLETE | — |
| gh-pages concurrency serialization (docs + charts) | COMPLETE | — |
| CHANGELOG.md consumed by GitHub Release body | COMPLETE | — |
| helm classic repo install path | COMPLETE | — (index.yaml + .tgz confirmed live) |
| PullErrors metric + layer fields (FIX-01, FIX-02) | COMPLETE | — |

**5/5 flows complete.**

| Phase 2 VERIFICATION.md status `human_needed` not updated to `passed` after Phase 3 live confirmation | INFO | Stale status only |

### Phase 3: Release Automation

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| `03-01-SUMMARY.md`, `03-02-SUMMARY.md` missing `requirements-completed` field | INFO | HELM-01–REL-02 not in frontmatter; VERIFICATION.md covers all |
| `ci.yml` OCI URL in release body hardcodes `d44b` owner | INFO | No functional impact for `d44b/pulltrace`; breaks forks |

### Phase 4: Launch

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Phase 4 VERIFICATION.md status `human_needed` — docker/helm pull not locally confirmed | INFO | API confirms packages public + tagged; only confirmation step outstanding |

### Global

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| ROADMAP.md Phase 1 and Phase 2 checkboxes `[ ]` (not marked complete) | INFO | Misleading stale state in planning docs |
| No unit or integration tests for any Go package | WARNING | Pre-existing; not introduced in this milestone; risk surface for future changes |

**Total tech debt: 12 items across 5 categories. 0 critical. 2 warnings. 10 informational.**

## Gaps Summary

### Critical Blockers (require resolution before milestone is complete)

**1. README.md Quick Start broken URL**

The `helm repo add` command on README.md line 50 uses `https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace` instead of `https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace/charts`. A user who visits the GitHub repository page and runs the Quick Start command will fail silently with a YAML parse error from Helm. The fix is a one-line change.

**Fix:**
```
# README.md line 50 — change to:
helm repo add pulltrace https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace/charts
```

This fix does not require a new tag. It's a documentation correction to the README on main.
