<objective>
Create and update the two community files required for open-source credibility: CONTRIBUTING.md (add Go 1.22 Docker workaround) and CHANGELOG.md (create from scratch).

Purpose: A contributor visiting the repo for the first time needs to be able to build the project. CHANGELOG.md is also a hard prerequisite for the Phase 3 release body.
Output: Two community files at repo root that satisfy COMM-01 and COMM-02.

DO NOT create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. It has been intentionally removed from this project and must not be recreated.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Go 1.22 Docker workaround to CONTRIBUTING.md</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
    Read CONTRIBUTING.md first. The file currently has build steps but is missing the Go 1.22 + Docker workaround (project memory: local machine has Go 1.18, go.mod requires 1.22.0 — `make build` fails locally).

    Insert a new subsection titled "Building with Docker (Go 1.22 required locally)" immediately before the `make build` command in the existing "Development Setup" or equivalent build section. Do NOT place it at the end of the file.

    The subsection must explain:
    - Why it's needed: go.mod requires Go 1.22.0; developers with older Go installations cannot run `make build` directly
    - The Docker-based workaround command: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app golang:1.22 go build ./...`
    - For running tests: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app golang:1.22 go test ./...`
    - Note that CI uses Go 1.22 via the Dockerfile, so pushed code will build correctly even if local build fails

    Check Dockerfile.server or Dockerfile.agent to confirm the exact Go version used in Docker (use that version in the workaround command, not a hardcoded "1.22"). Use the actual FROM line version.

    Preserve all existing content. Only insert the new subsection; do not rewrite surrounding content.

  <name>Task 2: Create CHANGELOG.md from scratch</name>
  <files>CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
    Create CHANGELOG.md at the repo root. The file does not currently exist.

    Use keep-a-changelog v1.1.0 format (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/):

    ```markdown
    # Changelog

    All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

    The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
    and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

    ## [Unreleased]

    ## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-23

    ### Added
    - Real-time container image pull progress monitoring via containerd socket
    - Layer-by-layer download progress with bytesPerSec and estimated time remaining
    - Kubernetes pod correlation — matches active pulls to waiting pods by image name
    - Prometheus metrics: `pulltrace_pulls_active`, `pulltrace_pulls_total`, `pulltrace_pull_duration_seconds`, `pulltrace_pull_bytes_total`, `pulltrace_pull_errors_total`
    - Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming for live browser updates without polling
    - React + Vite web UI with per-pull expandable layer detail view
    - Helm chart for Kubernetes DaemonSet + server deployment

    [Unreleased]: https://github.com/d44b/pulltrace/compare/v0.1.0...HEAD
    [0.1.0]: https://github.com/d44b/pulltrace/releases/tag/v0.1.0
    ```

    Note: The comparison links at the bottom will 404 until the v0.1.0 tag is pushed in Phase 4. This is acceptable — the links are correct and will resolve after Phase 4. Do not remove them.
