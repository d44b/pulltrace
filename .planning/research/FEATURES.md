# Feature Research

**Domain:** Open source Kubernetes observability tool — release process and documentation
**Researched:** 2026-02-23
**Confidence:** HIGH (verified against cert-manager, KEDA, external-secrets, metrics-server, flux2 official sources)

---

## Context

This research answers: what does a credible v0.1.0 open source Kubernetes tool release look like?
Pulltrace already has a working product core (agent, server, UI, Helm chart, CI). The gap is the
"release wrapper" — the files, pages, and process that make strangers trust the project enough to
install it on their cluster.

Examined projects: cert-manager, KEDA, external-secrets, metrics-server, flux2.

---

## Feature Landscape

### Table Stakes (Users Expect These)

Features that signal "this project is real." Missing these = project feels abandoned or risky to
adopt. Kubernetes users are security-conscious and evaluate projects by whether they follow standard
conventions before installing anything with cluster-level permissions.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| CONTRIBUTING.md | Every credible open source project has one; Kubernetes template project requires it | LOW | Needs: prerequisites, `make build`, local dev with kind, `make lint`, PR process. Metrics-server example is minimal but functional (~200 lines). |
| CHANGELOG.md | Users need to understand what changed between versions; keep-a-changelog format is standard | LOW | Must have `[Unreleased]` section at top; categorize with Added/Changed/Fixed/Security headers; YYYY-MM-DD dates; latest-first. |
| CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | Standard for any project inviting contributions; Kubernetes community requires it | LOW | Can reference Contributor Covenant verbatim. Not custom-written. |
| GitHub Release v0.1.0 | Without a Release, the project has no version; users can't pin installs; CI is wired but untriggered | LOW | Requires: git tag v0.1.0, release body with install commands, what's included, assets attached. Release body is the first thing adopters read. |
| GitHub Release body with install instructions | Users copy-paste install from release page, not README | LOW | Must include: `helm repo add`, `helm install`, version compatibility (K8s 1.28+ / containerd v2), and port-forward access command. |
| Helm repo via `helm repo add` | The README already shows this command (`helm repo add pulltrace https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace`); it must work | MEDIUM | Requires: gh-pages branch, `index.yaml` generated by chart-releaser-action or `helm repo index`. OCI-only install is non-standard; this is the expected install path. |
| README badges (CI, license, Kubernetes) | All serious K8s tools (cert-manager, KEDA, ESO) have them; users check build status before adopting | LOW | Minimum: CI status badge (GitHub Actions), license badge (Apache 2.0), Kubernetes version compatibility badge. Aim for 4–6; avoid badge bloat. |
| GitHub repository topics and description | Discoverability on GitHub search; cert-manager, KEDA, ESO all have well-chosen topics | LOW | Topics: `kubernetes`, `kubectl`, `image-pull`, `containerd`, `observability`, `helm`, `daemonset`. Description: one-sentence value prop. |
| LICENSE present and correct | Apache 2.0 already exists; must be in root | NONE | Already done. |
| SECURITY.md (threat model) | Already exists. Required for any tool accessing containerd socket or K8s API | NONE | Already done. |

### Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that signal quality and build community trust beyond the baseline. These are what separate
"someone's weekend project" from "a project worth starring and contributing to."

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Documentation site (GitHub Pages, Material for MkDocs) | Serious K8s tools all have dedicated doc sites (cert-manager.io, keda.sh, external-secrets.io). A README alone signals v0.1 hobbyist; a docs site signals production-intent | MEDIUM | Material for MkDocs + GitHub Pages is the standard. Deploy with one GitHub Actions workflow (`mkdocs gh-deploy`). Minimum pages: Getting Started, Installation, Configuration Reference, Architecture. |
| Artifact Hub listing | The Helm chart discoverability hub; many users find tools here first. cert-manager, KEDA, ESO all listed | LOW | Requires: `artifacthub-repo.yml` in gh-pages root, correct `Chart.yaml` metadata. Adds discoverability immediately. One-time setup. |
| Compatibility matrix in docs | Users evaluating Kubernetes observability tools need to know: "does this work with my cluster version?" | LOW | Table: Pulltrace version vs Kubernetes version vs containerd version. Mirrors what metrics-server does. |
| Architecture diagram in docs (not just README) | Full architecture explanation builds confidence for operators deploying privileged DaemonSets | LOW | Copy/expand what's in README. Explain agent → server → SSE → UI data flow. Add sequence diagram for pull lifecycle. |
| ADOPTERS.md (deferred) | Shows real-world usage; external-secrets has this | LOW | Premature for v0.1.0. Add after first community installs. |
| GitHub social preview image | Displayed on GitHub and in link previews (Slack, Twitter); adds visual identity | LOW | Can be created with any image tool. 1280x640px. Shows project name, logo, tagline. Not critical but differentiates. |
| SBOM / cosign signing (deferred) | KEDA, cert-manager, flux2 sign releases; increasingly expected for supply chain security | HIGH | Not needed for v0.1.0 — appropriate for v1.0.0 or when adopted by enterprises. GoReleaser can add this later. |
| GoReleaser integration (deferred) | Automates multi-platform binary builds, checksums, release body generation | MEDIUM | Current project has no standalone binaries (agent + server are Docker images). Not needed for v0.1.0. Relevant if/when a `pulltrace-cli` tool is added. |

### Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Versioned docs site (docs/v0.1.0/, docs/v0.2.0/) | "Professional" docs sites like KEDA have version selectors | Massive complexity overhead for a v0.1.0 with one version; Mike versioning plugin or equivalent requires careful setup and maintenance | Single version docs are standard for early projects. Add versioning when breaking API changes happen (v1.0.0+). |
| Full API reference auto-generated from code | Looks comprehensive; cert-manager has this | Requires significant tooling (godoc → markdown, custom CI). Not yet valuable when the API is still evolving | Write a manual Configuration Reference page covering Helm values and HTTP API endpoints. Update it when values.yaml changes. |
| Separate docs repo | Some projects split docs into own repository | Adds PR friction; contributors can't update docs and code in same PR; sync burden | Keep docs in `docs/` subdirectory of main repo. MkDocs Material reads from there. |
| Detailed contributor guide with DCO / CLA | Enterprise projects need this | Over-engineering for a small tool; adds friction to first contributions | Simple CONTRIBUTING.md (dev setup + `make lint` + `make test` + PR description guidelines). Reference Apache 2.0 license; no CLA needed. |
| ROADMAP.md for v0.1.0 | Shows direction | Signals that current state is incomplete; distracts from trusting what ships in v0.1.0 | Link to GitHub Milestones or Issues instead. Add ROADMAP.md after first external adoption. |
| Multi-channel community (Slack workspace, mailing list) | KEDA has Slack; cert-manager has Google Groups | Overhead to moderate; empty channels signal low adoption; premature | GitHub Issues + GitHub Discussions is sufficient for v0.1.0. Add Slack invite only when there's community demand. |

### Dependency Notes

- **Helm repo is a prerequisite for Artifact Hub**: ArtifactHub indexes from `index.yaml`, so classic Helm repo must be in place first. OCI registry alone does not satisfy ArtifactHub indexing for the standard helm-charts repository type.
- **gh-pages branch can host both docs and Helm repo**: MkDocs deploys to gh-pages; Chart Releaser Action also writes to gh-pages. They coexist — docs go to `docs/` path structure, `index.yaml` lives at root. Both are readable at `https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace/`.
- **CHANGELOG.md must exist before GitHub Release**: Release body should link to or summarize CHANGELOG entries. Don't create a release before CHANGELOG is written.
- **GitHub Release triggers CI artifact delivery**: The tag `v0.1.0` already triggers Docker image push and Helm OCI push in existing CI. Release body should be written before tagging.

---

## MVP Definition

### Launch With (v0.1.0)

The minimum set of release artifacts needed for a stranger to trust and install Pulltrace.

- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md** — dev setup, prerequisites, `make` commands, PR guidelines. Users who want to file issues or fork need this. (~1–2 hours to write.)
- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md** — keep-a-changelog format, `[Unreleased]` section, `[0.1.0] - 2026-XX-XX` entry listing what's included. Required before tagging.
- [ ] **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** — Contributor Covenant v2.1 verbatim copy. (~15 minutes.)
- [ ] **Helm repo on GitHub Pages** — `helm repo add pulltrace https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace` must work. This is the install path shown in README. Required before anyone can install.
- [ ] **GitHub Release v0.1.0** — release body with: what Pulltrace is (2 sentences), K8s/containerd compatibility, install commands, known limitations, link to full docs. Tag triggers CI for Docker + Helm OCI push.
- [ ] **README badges** — GitHub Actions CI, Apache 2.0 license, Kubernetes 1.28+ badge. Shields.io URLs.
- [ ] **GitHub repo metadata** — description + topics (`kubernetes`, `image-pull`, `containerd`, `observability`, `helm`).
- [ ] **Documentation site (GitHub Pages, Material for MkDocs)** — minimum pages: Getting Started (install + access UI), Configuration Reference (values.yaml table), Architecture Overview, Known Limitations. Replaces the wall-of-text README for users who want depth.

### Add After Validation (v0.1.x)

Features to add once first adopters have used the tool.

- [ ] **Artifact Hub listing** — adds discoverability; trivial to add once Helm repo exists. Trigger: first real install confirmed.
- [ ] **ADOPTERS.md** — adds social proof. Trigger: first organization confirms production use.
- [ ] **FAQ page in docs** — answers the 3–5 questions that appear repeatedly in Issues. Trigger: first batch of GitHub Issues.
- [ ] **GitHub Discussions enabled** — structured Q&A channel. Trigger: when Issues are being used for questions rather than bugs.
- [ ] **GitHub social preview image** — visual identity for link shares. Trigger: any social sharing of the project.

### Future Consideration (v1.0+)

- [ ] **SBOM + cosign image signing** — supply chain security; required by enterprises but adds workflow complexity. Defer until enterprise interest is established.
- [ ] **GoReleaser integration** — relevant if a standalone `pulltrace` CLI binary is added.
- [ ] **Versioned docs** — needed only when breaking API or configuration changes ship.
- [ ] **ROADMAP.md** — appropriate after initial community forms and future direction is validated.

## Competitor Feature Analysis

Based on examination of cert-manager, KEDA, external-secrets, metrics-server, and flux2.

| Feature | cert-manager | KEDA | metrics-server | Our Approach |
|---------|--------------|------|----------------|--------------|
| CONTRIBUTING.md | Yes (detailed, delegates to k8s community docs) | Yes (BUILD.md + CONTRIBUTING.md) | Yes (minimal, ~8 sections, delegates) | Write minimal: prerequisites, make commands, PR guidelines |
| CHANGELOG.md | Referenced in README, separate CHANGELOG dir | Yes (root-level CHANGELOG.md) | Not present at root; GitHub Releases serve this purpose | Yes, keep-a-changelog format, root-level file |
| CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | Yes | Yes (in .github/) | Yes (`code-of-conduct.md`) | Yes, Contributor Covenant v2.1 |
| Dedicated docs site | cert-manager.io (Docsy Hugo) | keda.sh (custom) | GitHub README only | Material for MkDocs on GitHub Pages — simpler than Hugo, good enough |
| Artifact Hub | Yes | Yes | Yes | Add after Helm repo is live |
| Release body format | Breaking changes, features, fixes, contributors | Highlights, breaking, deprecations, features, improvements, fixes, contributors | Simple: `Changes since vX.Y.Z` + improvements + contributors | Follow KEDA's format for first release: what's included, install commands, compatibility, contributors |
| Release assets attached | 22 assets (checksums, SBOMs, multi-arch) | 5 assets | 14 assets (components.yaml prominent) | At minimum: attach Helm chart tarball. Checksums welcome. SBOM can wait. |
| GitHub Actions CI badge | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes — already have workflow, add badge |
| `helm repo add` support | Yes | Yes | N/A | Yes — required; OCI-only is non-standard |
| Known Limitations page | Yes (`KNOWN_ISSUES.md` in metrics-server; cert-manager uses versioned known issues) | Indirectly via deprecation docs | Yes (`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`) | Include in docs site and in GitHub Release body |

---

## Docs Site Page Inventory (Material for MkDocs)

Minimum credible docs site structure, based on how cert-manager and external-secrets organize theirs:

```
docs/
├── index.md              # Landing page: what it is, 2-line install, link to getting started
├── getting-started.md    # Full install + verify + port-forward + open UI
├── configuration.md      # All values.yaml options (table), env vars, auth token setup
├── architecture.md       # How agent/server/SSE/UI fit together; sequence diagram
├── prometheus.md         # Metrics reference table; sample Prometheus scrape config
├── known-limitations.md  # containerd v2 only, cached layers invisible, single-cluster
└── contributing.md       # Link to CONTRIBUTING.md or embed its content
```

Seven pages is sufficient. The structure mirrors what cert-manager offers for its "Installation" and
"Reference" sections, scoped to what Pulltrace actually has.

---

## GitHub Release Body Template (v0.1.0)

What the release body should contain, based on patterns from metrics-server (simple) and KEDA (comprehensive). For a v0.1.0, lean closer to metrics-server's simplicity.

```
## Pulltrace v0.1.0

Real-time container image pull progress for Kubernetes. Pulltrace connects to the containerd
runtime on each node to track layer-by-layer download progress, correlates pulls with waiting pods,
and streams live updates to a web UI, Prometheus metrics, and SSE endpoint.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes 1.28+
- containerd v2 runtime
- Helm 3.x (for installation)

## Install

helm repo add pulltrace https://d44b.github.io/pulltrace
helm install pulltrace pulltrace/pulltrace -n pulltrace --create-namespace

## Access the UI

kubectl port-forward -n pulltrace svc/pulltrace-server 8080:8080
# Open http://localhost:8080

## Container Images

- ghcr.io/d44b/pulltrace-agent:v0.1.0
- ghcr.io/d44b/pulltrace-server:v0.1.0
